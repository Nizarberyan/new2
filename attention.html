MGirl, would it kill you just to throw a little bit of attention?
If I hurt you, I'm afraid God's gonna teach me a lesson
Now would you hate me if I said goodbye
So quick you could eat my dust?
Now would you hate me if I run like hell
In the wind from dawn 'til dusk?
When you cry, you waste your time
Over boys you never liked

Can you not be so obvious?
So keep it light
So keep it light

Now, I thought I'd vocalized my traumas
But nobody will listen, hm
I know I'm cryptic and I'm weird
That shit comes off as indifferent, hm
I don't wanna die so young
Got so much to do
I don't smile for the camera
Only smile for you
Smile for you

Now would you hate me if I said goodbye
So quick you could eat my dust?
Now would you hate me if I ran like hell
In the wind from dawn 'til dusk?
When you cry, you waste your time
Over boys you never liked
Can you not?
